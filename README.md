Tree-sitter powered textobjects for evil mode in Emacs.

> This is an Emacs port of [nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects).

This package will let you create evil textobjects using tree-sitter
grammars. You can easily create function,class,comment etc textobjects
in multiple languages.

# Installation & Usage

You can install `evil-textobj-tree-sitter` from melpa. Here is how you would do it using `use-package` and `package.el`:

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-textobj-tree-sitter :ensure t)
```

Or you can use `straight.el`:

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-textobj-tree-sitter :straight t)
```

Or using `straight.el` and `el-get` to pull from source:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package evil-textobj-tree-sitter
  :straight (evil-textobj-tree-sitter :type git
                      :host github
                      :repo "meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter"
                      :files (:defaults "queries")))
```

> You will also have to setup [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter).

# Mapping textobjects

By default, the library does not provide any keybindings, but it
should be relatively easy to add them.

```emacs-lisp
;; bind `function.outer`(entire function block) to `f` for use in things like `vaf`, `yaf`
(define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "f" (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj "function.outer"))
;; bind `function.inner`(function block without name and args) to `f` for use in things like `vif`, `yif`
(define-key evil-inner-text-objects-map "f" (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj "function.inner"))
```

We support quite a few textobjects. You can find a list of available
textobjects at
[nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects#built-in-textobjects).
We might not have support for all of them as
[emacs-tree-sitter](https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter)
does not yet support all the languages as of now. As for the list of
languages that we support you can check the value of
`evil-textobj-tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist`.

# Custom textobjects

If you are not able to find the text object that you are looking for
in the builtin list, you can create custom text objects by passing the
a custom query with captures.

For example if you want to create text object to select `import`
statements, you can write something like below. *You will have to
provide the tree-sitter queries for all the languages that you want it
to work for*

``` emacs-lisp
;; The first arguemnt to `evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj' will be the capture group to use
;; and the second arg will be an alist mapping major-mode to the corresponding query to use.
(define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "m" (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj "import"
                                              '((python-mode . [(import_statement) @import])
                                                (rust-mode . [(use_declaration) @import]))))
```

# Goto

We have also added support for for a fancier version of
`goto-char`. You can use this to go to the next function, previous
class or do any motions like that.

You can use the `evil-textobj-tree-sitter-goto-textobj` function to
invoke goto. You can either use this in other function or just bound
to a key. The first argument is the textobj that you want to use, the
second one specifies if you want to search forward or backward and the
last one is for specifying wheather to go to the start or end of the
textobj.

Below are some sample binding that you can do. You can use any textobj
that is available here.

``` emacs-lisp
;; Goto start of next function
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "]f") (lambda ()
                                                  (interactive)
                                                  (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-goto-textobj "function.outer")))
;; Goto start of previous function
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "[f") (lambda ()
                                                  (interactive)
                                                  (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-goto-textobj "function.outer" t)))
;; Goto end of next function
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "]F") (lambda ()
                                                  (interactive)
                                                  (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-goto-textobj "function.outer" nil t)))
;; Goto end of previous function
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "[F") (lambda ()
                                                  (interactive)
                                                  (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-goto-textobj "function.outer" t t)))
```

# Contributing new textobjects

As I have already mentioned, I pull the text objects from
[nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects#built-in-textobjects)
project. This right now automatically happens every friday using a
[Github Action](https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-queries.yaml)
which will create a new PR on the repo. So if you would like to
update/add the builtin tree-sitter objects, feel free to update them
in the neovim project repository. Unless there is something Emacs
specific I recommend everyone to just submit the new queries to that
project.

If you are adding a completely new language, there is two other things
that you will have to do to make sure everything will work well.

1) Make sure the lang is available in [emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/tree/master/queries)
2) Make sure we have a `major-mode` mapping in [evil-textobj-tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist](https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter/blob/d416b3ab8610f179defadd58f5c20fdc65bf21e5/evil-textobj-tree-sitter.el#L40)
