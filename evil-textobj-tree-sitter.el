;;; Commentary:
;; This package is a port of nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects.
;; This package will let you create evil textobjects using the power
;; of tree-sitter grammars.  You can easily create
;; function,class,comment etc textobjects in multiple languages.
;;
;; You can do a sample map like below to create a function textobj.
;; (define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "f"
;;             (evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj "function.outer"))
;; `evil-textobj-tree-sitter-get-textobj' will return you a function
;; that you can use in a define-key map.  You can pass in any of the
;; supported queries as an arg of that function.  You can also pass in
;; multiple queries as a list and we will match on all of them, ranked
;; on which ones comes up first in the file.
;; You can find more info in the  README.md file at
;; https://github.com/meain/evil-textobj-tree-sitter

;; This package also provides with thing-at-point functions for common
;; textobjects like functions, loops, conditionals etc.

;; You need to either have elisp-tree-sitter installed or have Emacs
;; version >=29 for this package to work.
